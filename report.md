# Binance Futures Order Bot - Implementation Analysis

## Core Components

### 1. Base Order Implementation
- Implemented in `src/base_order.py`
- Handles common functionality for all order types:
  - API client initialization
  - Input validation
  - Error handling with retries
  - Structured logging

### 2. Order Types

#### Basic Orders
1. Market Orders (`src/market_orders.py`)
   - Immediate execution at market price
   - Basic price and quantity validation
   - Example usage successfully tested

2. Limit Orders (`src/limit_orders.py`)
   - Price and quantity validation with tick size consideration
   - GTC (Good Till Cancel) time in force
   - Successfully tested with various price points

#### Advanced Orders

1. OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other)
   - Implemented in `src/advanced/oco.py`
   - Creates two linked orders:
     - Take profit (limit order)
     - Stop loss (stop-limit order)
   - Validates price levels against current market price
   - Successfully tested with test account

2. TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)
   - Implemented in `src/advanced/twap.py`
   - Splits large orders into smaller chunks
   - Configurable intervals between executions
   - Tested with 3 chunks over 2-minute period

3. Grid Trading
   - Implemented in `src/advanced/grid.py`
   - Creates multiple buy/sell orders at regular price intervals
   - Automatic price level calculation
   - Successfully tested with 5 grid levels

4. Stop-Limit Orders
   - Implemented in `src/advanced/stop_limit.py`
   - Combines trigger price with limit price
   - Price validation based on order side
   - Tested with both buy and sell scenarios

## Technical Features

### 1. Validation Layer
